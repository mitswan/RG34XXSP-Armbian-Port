# RG34XXSP Armbian Community Build

## What is this Project?

This project aims to create a complete Armbian community build for the RG34XXSP device, transforming it into a full-featured ARM64 Linux computer. Unlike gaming-focused distributions, this follows Armbian's mission to provide standard desktop and server computing capabilities on ARM hardware.

⚠️ **This is NOT a gaming distribution** - This project focuses on general-purpose computing following Armbian's mission.
