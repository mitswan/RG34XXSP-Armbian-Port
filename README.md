# RG34XXSP Armbian Community Build

## What is this Project?

This project aims to create a complete Armbian community build for the RG34XXSP device, transforming it into a full-featured ARM64 Linux computer. Unlike gaming-focused distributions, this follows Armbian's mission to provide standard desktop and server computing capabilities on ARM hardware.

🛠️ **Development Branch**: All Armbian code changes are being made on the [`rg34xxsp-support`](https://github.com/armbian/build/compare/main...mitswan:build:rg34xxsp-support) branch for eventual upstream submission.

⚠️ **This is NOT a gaming distribution** - This project focuses on general-purpose computing following Armbian's mission.

## Development Status

**Status:** Phase 0 planning complete with comprehensive documentation, helper scripts, and implementation plan. Ready to begin Phase 1 development environment setup.
