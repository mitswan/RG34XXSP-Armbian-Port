## Build Testing Strategy

### Repository Management Protocol
**Before any development work:**
1. **Clean Environment**: Run `./clean_repos.sh` to ensure clean state
2. **Restore Repositories**: Run `./restore_repos.sh` to restore all needed repositories
3. **Verify Setup**: Confirm all repositories are present and accessible

### Continuous Integration Testing
**After each major change:**
1. **Kernel Build Test**: `./compile.sh kernel BOARD=rg34xxsp BRANCH=current KERNEL_BTF=no`
2. **Device Tree Check**: `./compile.sh dts-check BOARD=rg34xxsp BRANCH=current`
3. **Full Image Build**: `./compile.sh build BOARD=rg34xxsp BRANCH=current RELEASE=noble KERNEL_BTF=no`
4. **Git Tracking**: Commit armbian-build changes to `rg34xxsp-support` branch with descriptive messages
5. **Update README**: Update phase indicators and add 1-sentence summary of commit changes
6. **Git Commit**: Only after successful build tests and README updates

### Armbian Submission Preparation
**Git workflow for upstream contribution:**
1. **Branch Setup**: Use `rg34xxsp-support` branch in `repos_to_update/armbian-build-rg34xxsp-support-branch/`
2. **Atomic Commits**: Separate commits for board config, device tree, kernel patches, and BSP packages
3. **Commit Messages**: Include hardware testing results and component descriptions
4. **Upstream Sync**: Regular rebasing against `upstream/main` before submission
5. **Human Submission**: When ready, notify human to manually submit pull request (Claude cannot submit)

### Recommended Commit Structure (4-8 commits total)
**Core Infrastructure (3-4 commits):**
1. **Board Configuration**: `config/boards/rg34xxsp.conf` - Main board definition
2. **Device Tree**: `.dts` file for RG34XXSP hardware definition
3. **Bootloader Config**: U-Boot defconfig if custom configuration needed
4. **Kernel Config**: H700-specific kernel configuration changes

**Hardware Support (2-3 commits):**
5. **Display & Input Patches**: Screen panel and controller support patches
6. **Audio & Power Patches**: Sound codec and power management patches
7. **Connectivity Patches**: WiFi/Bluetooth driver patches if needed

**Integration (1 commit):**
8. **BSP Package**: Board-specific post-install scripts and system services

**Commit Guidelines:**
- **Logical Separation**: Each commit should be a complete, working feature
- **Atomic Changes**: One functional area per commit (avoid mixing unrelated changes)
- **Bisectable**: Each commit should build successfully without errors
- **Descriptive Messages**: Include testing results and hardware validation details
- **Anti-Patterns**: Avoid 20+ tiny commits or 1 massive commit with everything

### Debugging and Rollback Strategy
**When builds fail or regressions occur:**
1. **Check Git History**: Use `git log --oneline` to identify last working commit
2. **Rollback Options**: Use `git revert <commit>` or `git reset --hard <commit>` to return to working state
3. **Incremental Changes**: Make smaller, testable changes to isolate issues
4. **Build Comparison**: Compare failed builds with previous working builds using git diff
5. **Repository Reset**: Use `./clean_repos.sh && ./restore_repos.sh` to reset development environment

### Build Validation Checklist
- [ ] Clean build completes without errors
- [ ] Device tree compiles successfully
- [ ] No missing dependencies
- [ ] Image size within reasonable limits
- [ ] All required files present in output

## User Testing Strategy

### Testing Protocol
1. **Pre-Test**: Create TESTING.md with specific test instructions
2. **User Execution**: User follows TESTING.md procedures
3. **Results Collection**: User updates TESTING.md with results
4. **Issue Resolution**: If tests fail, use git rollback to return to last working build before debugging
5. **Phase Completion**: Only proceed after successful test confirmation

### Git-Based Debugging Workflow
**When hardware tests fail:**
1. **Identify Regression**: Compare current failing build with last working build using git history
2. **Rollback to Working State**: Use `git log --oneline` to find last working commit, then `git reset --hard <commit>`
3. **Incremental Testing**: Make small changes and test each step to isolate the problem
4. **Build Bisection**: Use `git bisect` to systematically find the commit that introduced the issue
5. **Clean Environment**: Reset repository environment with `./clean_repos.sh && ./restore_repos.sh` if needed

### Hardware Testing Requirements
- **RG34XXSP Device**: Physical hardware for testing
- **Serial Console**: UART access for debugging
- **Test SD Cards**: Multiple high-speed SD cards
- **Network Access**: WiFi network for connectivity testing

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Device Tree Complexity**: ROCKNIX device tree may need significant adaptation
   - **Mitigation**: Start with minimal device tree, add features incrementally
2. **Driver Compatibility**: H700 drivers may not work with mainline kernel
   - **Mitigation**: Test each driver component separately
3. **Hardware Variations**: Different RG34XXSP revisions may have different hardware
   - **Mitigation**: Document hardware differences, create variant support

### Process Risks
1. **Build Environment**: Armbian build system complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Follow ARMBIAN_COMMUNITY_BUILD_GUIDE.md exactly
2. **Testing Bottleneck**: Limited hardware availability for testing
   - **Mitigation**: Implement thorough build-time validation
3. **Community Acceptance**: Armbian community may have specific requirements
   - **Mitigation**: Engage with community early, follow all guidelines
4. **Development Regressions**: Changes may break previously working functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Use git version control extensively for rollback capability

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success Criteria
- **Boot Time**: <45 seconds to login prompt
- **Hardware Functionality**: All hardware components working
- **Build Reliability**: 95%+ successful builds
- **Performance**: Comparable to stock firmware

### Community Success Criteria
- **Code Quality**: Passes Armbian community review
- **Documentation**: Complete user and developer documentation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Maintenance**: Sustainable long-term maintenance plan

## Next Steps

1. **Repository Setup**: Run `./clean_repos.sh` then `./restore_repos.sh` to prepare development environment
2. **Phase 1 Start**: Begin with development environment setup following repository management protocol
3. **Community Engagement**: Engage with Armbian community for guidance
4. **Hardware Acquisition**: Ensure RG34XXSP hardware availability
5. **Testing Setup**: Prepare testing environment and procedures

**Important**: Always use the repository management scripts (`clean_repos.sh` and `restore_repos.sh`) when working with the reference and development repositories. This ensures a consistent, clean development environment and prevents conflicts with the main project git repository.

This plan provides a structured, testable approach to creating RG34XXSP Armbian support while following community standards and leveraging existing H700 implementations. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring stable progress toward full hardware support.
