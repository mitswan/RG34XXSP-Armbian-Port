- **README.md Maintenance**: For every commit, update README.md phase indicators; update status only for implementation progress (not style changes)
- **Human-Only Submissions**: Never submit pull requests to Armbian team; notify human when submission is ready

## Development Rules

### Rule 1: Documentation Reference for PLAN.md Updates
**MANDATORY**: When updating PLAN.md, Claude must ALWAYS reference and incorporate information from:
1. **ALTERNATIVE_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md** - For understanding existing H700 implementations and their approaches
2. **HARDWARE.md** - For hardware specifications and distribution-specific handling
3. **ARMBIAN_COMMUNITY_BUILD_GUIDE.md** - For Armbian-specific build requirements and community guidelines

This ensures all planning decisions are based on:
- Proven implementations from other distributions
- Complete hardware understanding
- Armbian community standards and best practices

### Rule 2: Documentation Reference for Plan Execution
**MANDATORY**: When executing the plan, Claude must ALWAYS reference and consult:
1. **ALTERNATIVE_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md** - For implementation patterns and proven solutions
2. **HARDWARE.md** - For hardware-specific requirements and constraints

This ensures all implementation decisions are informed by existing successful approaches and hardware realities.

### Rule 3: Testing Confirmation Requirement
**MANDATORY**: Claude must NOT proceed to the next phase of implementation without explicit user confirmation that tests have passed. The process is:

1. **Test Creation**: Claude creates TESTING.md with specific test procedures for the current phase
2. **User Testing**: User performs tests on actual hardware following TESTING.md instructions
3. **Results Documentation**: User updates TESTING.md with test results and marks PASS/FAIL
4. **Confirmation Required**: Claude can only proceed when user confirms "ALL TESTS PASSED" in TESTING.md
5. **Issue Resolution**: If tests fail, Claude must fix issues and provide updated TESTING.md for retest

**No exceptions**: Implementation phases cannot proceed without successful user testing confirmation on actual hardware.

### Rule 4: TESTING.md Lifecycle Management
**MANDATORY**: The TESTING.md file must follow strict lifecycle management:

1. **Creation**: Only created when active testing is required for a specific phase
2. **Active Use**: Contains specific test procedures and user result documentation
3. **Completion**: After successful testing, results are incorporated into PLAN.md
4. **Cleanup**: TESTING.md is removed between testing phases to avoid confusion
5. **Regeneration**: New TESTING.md created for each new phase requiring testing

**Purpose**: Ensures testing documentation is current, relevant, and not cluttered with obsolete information.

### Rule 5: README.md Status Maintenance
**MANDATORY**: Before every git commit, Claude must update README.md with:

1. **Phase Indicators**: Update phase status using proper emojis:
   - ‚úÖ = Complete phases
   - ‚ñ∂Ô∏è = Current active phase (with ‚ú®*In Progress*‚ú® suffix)
   - üîú = Future pending phases

2. **Status Summary**: Replace the "Status:" field with exactly one sentence describing progress along the implementation plan (not minor style/documentation changes)

3. **Timing**: This update must happen before the git commit, ensuring the public GitHub page always reflects current development status

**Purpose**: Maintains up-to-date public visibility of project progress and current development state.

### Rule 6: Human-Only Armbian Submission
**MANDATORY**: All submissions to the Armbian team must be performed by a human, never by Claude.

1. **Claude Responsibility**: Prepare all code, documentation, and branch structure for submission
2. **Human Handoff**: When submission is ready, Claude must notify the human via console message
3. **Notification Format**: "üö® HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: Armbian submission ready. Please review and submit pull request manually."
4. **No Automation**: Claude must never attempt to create pull requests, contact maintainers, or submit code upstream
5. **Support Role**: Claude can assist with submission preparation but cannot execute the submission

**Purpose**: Ensures human oversight and responsibility for all upstream contributions to the Armbian project.

### Rule 7: Shell Command Error Learning
**MANDATORY**: When making shell command errors that could be prevented by better understanding or documentation, Claude must consider adding preventive guidance to CLAUDE.md.

1. **Error Analysis**: After encountering unexpected shell command failures, analyze if the error could have been prevented with better project-specific knowledge
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify if the error represents a class of mistakes likely to recur in this project context
3. **Documentation Update**: If the error reflects missing project knowledge or common pitfalls, add a preventive rule or reminder to this CLAUDE.md file
4. **Learning Integration**: Ensure future work benefits from lessons learned through systematic documentation

**Purpose**: Creates a self-improving documentation system that reduces repeat errors and builds project-specific shell command expertise.

### Rule 8: Host System Modification Approval
**MANDATORY**: Claude must always check with the user before making any changes to the host system configuration.

1. **Identification**: When encountering build issues that require host system changes (package installation, service configuration, system settings)
2. **User Consultation**: Present the issue and proposed solution to the user for approval before proceeding
3. **Alternatives**: Always provide both host system changes and containerized alternatives when possible
4. **Documentation**: Update PLAN.md with the user-approved solution for future reference

**Purpose**: Ensures user maintains control over their development environment and system configuration.

### Rule 9: Compression Validation and Timeout
**MANDATORY**: Claude must always validate compressed files before recommending them for testing.

1. **Compression Timeout**: Allow up to 10 minutes for compression/decompression operations
2. **Integrity Testing**: Always test compressed files using appropriate tools (e.g., `gzip -t`, `xz -t`, `7z t`) before marking them ready for testing
3. **Decompression Testing**: Always perform a full decompression test to verify the compressed file can be properly extracted
4. **Corruption Prevention**: If compression is interrupted or fails, remove corrupted files and retry with appropriate timeouts
5. **File Format**: Use gzip compression for broad compatibility with image flashing tools (Balena Etcher, Raspberry Pi Imager)
6. **Documentation**: Update TESTING.md with correct file names and formats after validation

**Purpose**: Prevents user frustration from corrupt compressed files and ensures reliable testing procedures.

### Rule 10: Local Build Storage with ALPHA Marking
**MANDATORY**: Claude must store builds locally in builds/ directory and mark all builds as ALPHA.

1. **Local Storage**: Store build files in builds/ directory (gitignored to avoid repository bloat)
2. **ALPHA Marking**: All builds must be clearly marked as ALPHA in filename and documentation
3. **File Format**: Use gzip compression for compatibility with image flashing tools
4. **Build Validation**: Test compression integrity before saving builds
5. **No Removal**: Never remove existing builds from builds/ directory - preserve all versions
6. **TESTING.md Updates**: Update TESTING.md with local file paths for testing
7. **Documentation**: Clearly mark builds as ALPHA quality in all documentation

**Purpose**: Provides local build storage while avoiding repository size issues and preserving build history.

### Rule 11: Local Build Testing Requirements
**MANDATORY**: Claude must clearly mark all builds as ALPHA quality for local testing.

1. **ALPHA Labeling**: All build files must include "ALPHA" in the filename
2. **Local Testing**: All testing uses local builds/ directory files
3. **Documentation**: TESTING.md must clearly state builds are ALPHA quality and local-only
4. **Validation Sequence**: Must complete compression integrity test before recommending testing
5. **Build Preservation**: Never remove or overwrite existing builds - maintain version history
6. **Warning Labels**: All documentation must warn that builds are experimental/alpha quality
7. **External Distribution**: For sharing builds, use external hosting or manual transfer

**Purpose**: Ensures proper expectations about build stability while enabling local testing and build preservation.

### Rule 12: Strict Armbian Community Standards Compliance
**MANDATORY**: Claude must strictly follow Armbian's community board standards for all implementation decisions.

1. **Board Configuration**: Use `.csc` extension and modern `declare -g` syntax for community boards
2. **Naming Conventions**: Follow exact Armbian patterns for files, variables, and configurations
3. **Hardware Mapping**: Use correct board families, overlay prefixes, and device tree references
4. **Package Lists**: Include appropriate packages following established device category patterns
5. **BSP Structure**: Implement Board Support Package functions matching Armbian conventions
6. **Documentation**: Follow Armbian's community contribution guidelines and formatting
7. **Upstream Readiness**: Ensure all code changes are ready for Armbian upstream submission

**Purpose**: Maintains compatibility with Armbian ecosystem and ensures successful upstream integration.
